**Challenge requirements**
Create a program that does the following:

1. Has a conversation with the user
2. Stores information about the user - name, age, favourite colour, etc.
3. Uses the information to calculate more facts about the user - calculate birth year from age, for example
4. Responds to certain user inputs in different ways, such as agreeing that a specific colour is the best, but disliking others
5. Tells the user everything it has learnt throughout the conversation

```{r}
# Has a conversation with the user
name <- readline(prompt = "What's your name? ")

age <- readline(prompt = "How old are you? ")

height <- readline(prompt = "How tall are you? ")

weight <- readline(prompt = "How much do you weigh? ")

favor_color <- readline(prompt = "Which colour do you like best? ")
```

```{r}
# Calculate the facts about the user
current_year <- as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))
birth_year <- current_year - age
```
