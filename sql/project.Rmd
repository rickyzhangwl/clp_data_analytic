# 1. Discovery

This article is to analyze the sales data of a model kit provider. Their product line consists of model ships, planes, cars and military ground vehicles. I will access the data by creating a connection to the database.

As the sales data including the information of customers, orders, products, product lines and the company employees, I will answer **below business problems** in this article, so that the management could better understand the company's business status.

1. How is the sales of each product line?

2. What's the ordered quantity and stock quantity of each product?

3. As we have regional managers, what's the sales of the employees under each manager?

I will use advanced SQL functions such as subquery, OLAP, window function to answer.

# 2. Data Preparation

When working with databases, we should always use packages that are DBI-compliant.

The `odbc` package provides a standard way for us to connect to any database as long as we have an ODBC driver installed. The `odbc` package is DBI-compliant, and is recommended for ODBC connections in this project.

The `plotly` package is loaded for data visualization.

## 2.1 Connect to the Database
```{r}
# Load the DBI and odbc packages
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(plotly) # for visualization

# Verify that odbc recognizes the installed drivers using odbcListDrivers()
sort(unique(odbcListDrivers()[[1]]))
```

```{r}
# check the available driver
odbcListDrivers(
  keep = getOption("odbc.drivers_keep"),
  filter = getOption("odbc.drivers_filter")
)
```

Only `ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server` is available and we will use it for our connection.

```{r}
# Pass the server address, database name, and the credentials to be used to the connection
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc(),
                 Driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
                 Server = "aseaspdghrtrain.database.windows.net",
                 Database = "asdb-eas-pd-ghrtrain01",
                 UID = "xxxx",  # use your own userID
                 PWD = "xxxx", # use your own password
                 PORT = 1433)

# Check the connection
con
```
The connection is set up and we can specify the connection for all sql chunks in the following.

```{r setup}
# Set up the connection for all sql chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "con")
```

Now test with a simply query and save the result to a variable.
```{sql, output.var = "mydata"}
-- Select all from offices table
SELECT * 
FROM offices
```

```{r}
# Display the returned result
mydata
```

That worked and we can create the `entity relationship diagram (ERD)`.

## 2.2 ERD
By checking all the tables in the database, I created below ERD by [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). The primary key of each table is highlighed in **Red**. The data type of each column is listed as well. For table `orderDetails`, it has composite primary keys `orderNumber` and `productCode`.

# 3. Query for the Business Problems
## 3.1 The sales of each product line

```{sql, output.var = "top_productLine"}
SELECT 
    p.productLine,
    SUM(o.quantityOrdered * o.priceEach) AS totalSales,
    Round (SUM(o.quantityOrdered * o.priceEach) / (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) FROM orderdetails), 3) AS salesPct, -- Use subquery, and use Round function to set decimal
    SUM(o.quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantity
FROM orderdetails AS o
LEFT JOIN products AS p
ON o.productCode = p.productCode
Group BY p.productLine
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```


```{r}
# check the query result
top_productLine
```

This table is what we want and we can proceed the data visualization for presentation.

```{r}
# Plot the total sales percentage of different product lines
fig1 <- plot_ly(data = top_productLine, labels = ~productLine, values = ~totalSales, 
                type = 'pie',
                text = ~totalSales,
                textposition = 'inside',
                textinfo = 'label+percent',
                insidetextfont = list(color = '#FFFFFF'),
                hovertemplate = "%{label}<br>Sales: %{text:,.0f}<br>Percentage: %{percent}<extra></extra>",
                marker = list(colors = brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "Paired"),
                              line = list(color = '#FFFFFF', width = 1)),
                showlegend = FALSE)

fig1 <- fig1 %>% layout(title = 'Total Sales Percentage by Different Product Lines',
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))

fig1
```

Beside, we can plot the ordered quantity of each product line.

```{r}
# Plot the ordered quantity of different product lines
fig2 <- plot_ly(data = top_productLine, y = ~reorder(productLine, totalQuantity), 
                x = ~totalQuantity,
                type = "bar", 
                orientation = "h",
                text = ~totalQuantity,
                texttemplate = "%{x:,}",
                textposition = "auto",
                hovertemplate = "%{label}<br>Ordered Qty: %{text:,}<extra></extra>",
                width = 700,
                height = 400)

fig2 <- fig2 %>% layout(title = "Total Quantity Ordered by Different Product Lines",
                        yaxis = list(title = ""),
                        xaxis = list(title = "", showgrid = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))

fig2
```

**Classic cars** is the biggest product line by sales and quantity sold, accounting for about 40% of total sales. Vintage cars is the second biggest. Compared to other product lines, **Trains** is the much smaller product line, only accounting for about 2% of total sales.

## 3.2 The ordered and stock quantity of each product

We can use below query to generate the quantity sold and in stock for each product.

```{sql, output.var = "top_products"}
SELECT 
    pl.productLine,
    p.productName,
    SUM(od.quantityOrdered) AS salesQuantity,
    AVG(p.quantityInStock) AS stockQuantity
FROM 
    productlines AS pl, 
    products AS p, 
    orderdetails AS od
WHERE p.productLine = pl.productLine
AND p.productCode = od.productCode
GROUP BY pl.productLine, p.productName
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC;
```

```{r}
# check the result
top_products
```
We can see that the company has a catalogue of **109** products. Now let's make a scatter plot to visualize the table, with a filter function for different procut lines.

```{r}
# plot the product sales and stock
fig3 <- plot_ly(data = top_products, x = ~salesQuantity, y = ~stockQuantity, 
               color = ~productLine, colors = "Paired",
               type = "scatter",
               mode = "markers",
               text = ~productName,
               hovertemplate = "%{text}<br>Order Qty: %{x}<br>Stock Qty: %{y}<extra></extra>",
               width = 750,
               height = 450,
               # add a filter
               transforms = list(
                                list(
                                  type = 'filter',
                                  target = ~productLine,
                                  operation = '=',
                                  value = unique(top_products$productLine))
               ))
# add dropdown list for the filter
fig3 <- fig3 %>% 
            layout(
              title = "Sales and Stock of Products",
              xaxis = list(title = "Sales Quantity"),
              yaxis = list(title = "Stock Quantity"),
              updatemenus = list(
              list(
                type = "dropdown",
                active = 0,
                yanchor = "bottom",
                buttons = list(
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)),
                       label = "All"),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[1]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[1]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[2]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[2]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[3]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[3]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[4]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[4]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[5]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[5]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[6]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[6]),
                  list(method = "restyle",
                       args = list("transforms[0].value", unique(top_products$productLine)[7]),
                       label = unique(top_products$productLine)[7])
              
                                )))
      )

```

We see an outlier! By checking the hovertext, we can know it is **1992 Ferrari 360 Spider Red**. It is so popular as only this classic car has an ordered quantity over 1800, while all of the other products are sold with a number between 767 and 1111. Besides, we don't have a product with very low ordered quantity.

By the filter, we can see that the **Train** product line only has 3 products. This is the contributing factor to its low sales.

In this plot, we can find the products with **low stock** (less than 200), they are: 

1. 1968 Mustang
2. 1928 Ford Phaeton Deluxe
3. 1997 BWM F650 ST
4. 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34

## 3.2 The sales of each sales manager and their subordinates

In `employees` table, each sales representative has a direct line manager to report to. I will create an SQL View to show the list of each manager and their subordinates.
```{sql}
-- create a sql view
CREATE VIEW supSub_rz AS
    (
    SELECT
        e2.employeeNumber AS managerID,
        CONCAT(e2.firstName, ' ', e2.lastName) AS managerName,
        e2.jobTitle,
        e1.employeeNumber AS subordinateID,
        CONCAT(e1.firstName, ' ', e1.lastName) AS subordinateName
    FROM employees AS e1, employees AS e2
    WHERE e1.reportsTo = e2.employeeNumber
    ORDER BY 1 OFFSET 0 ROWS
    );
```


```{sql}
-- check the created view
SELECT * 
FROM supSub_rz
```
That's it! The company has 22 employees in total, 1 President, 1 VP Sales. 3 Regional Sales Manager and 1 Sales Rep directly report to the VP Sales. The four guys also have their subordinates reporting to them.

Now let's write a query with OLAP function `ROLLUP` to return the sales number of each manager and their subordinates.

```{sql, output.var = "employee_sales"}
SELECT
    s.managerName,
    s.subordinateName,
    SUM(od.quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS sales
FROM supSub_rz AS s, customers AS c, orders AS o, orderdetails AS od
WHERE s.subordinateID= c.salesRepEmployeeNumber
AND c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
AND o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
GROUP BY ROLLUP(s.managerName, s.subordinateName) -- Use ROLLUP here
```

```{r}
# check the result
employee_sales
```
To have a clearer view for the management, we can add another column to show the sales rank under each sales manager, with window function `RANK`. According to the job title, we know that each sales manager is responsible for a region, such as NA, EMEA, APAC.

```{sql, output.var = "employee_rank"}
SELECT
    s.managerName,
    s.jobTitle,
    s.subordinateName,
    SUM(od.quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS sales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY managerName ORDER BY SUM(od.quantityOrdered * priceEach) DESC) AS salesRank -- window function
FROM supSub_rz AS s, customers AS c, orders AS o, orderdetails AS od
WHERE s.subordinateID= c.salesRepEmployeeNumber
AND c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
AND o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
GROUP BY s.managerName, s.jobTitle, s.subordinateName
```

```{r}
employee_rank
```

```{r}
# Plot the sales of different sales reps
fig4 <- plot_ly(data = employee_rank, y = ~reorder(subordinateName, sales),
                x = ~sales,
                color = ~managerName,
                type = "bar", 
                orientation = "h",
                text = ~salesRank,
                texttemplate = "%{text}",
                textposition = "auto",
                hovertemplate = "%{label}<br>Sales: %{x:,}<br>Region Rank: %{text}<extra></extra>",
                width = 700,
                height = 400)

fig4 <- fig4 %>% layout(title = "Employee Sales of Different Managers",
                        yaxis = list(title = ""),
                        xaxis = list(title = "", showgrid = TRUE, showticklabels = TRUE),
                        legend = list(x = 0.7, y = 0.2, 
                                      title = list(text = "<b> Line Manager </b>")))

fig4
```

In this plot, we can clearly see the sales of each sales rep. The sales of each sales rep vary a lot, in the range between 0.3M to over 1.2M. 4 out of the top 5 sales reps are from Gerard's team (EMEA Region), the other 1 is from Anthony's team (NA Region). The sales reps from William's team (APAC Region) has median sales number, while Mary, the company's VP Sales has Mami Nishi, who directly report to her.

# 4. Conclusion

From the above analysis, we can conclude that:

1. Classic cars and Vintage cars are the company's biggest product lines as both have much more sales than others. Trains is the smallest one, largely because of the low number of available products. The company should keep maintaining the good sales of car products. Developing more products in Trains can probably increase the sales of this product line.

2. The 1992 Ferrari 360 Spider Red is the company's flagship product. The company can make further analysis on the success of this product. The experience and marketing strategy is possible to be applied to other products. The company should pay attention to the 4 low-stock products, stock replenishment is necessary in case they cannot fulfill orders in the near future.

3. The company's top sales reps are almost for the EMEA and NA region. But some sales with the lowest sales number are also in the two regions. The company can further analyze the sales detail of each sales rep to better understand their performance.
